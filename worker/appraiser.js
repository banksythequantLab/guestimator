FIELD GUIDE (do not copy these sentences into the JSON):
- identification.name: what the item is, e.g. "Joseph Bayer 5-gallon salt-glazed stoneware crock". Never leave empty.
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 how sure you are of maker/period. 0.9 = stamped and consistent; 0.3 = style guess only.
- evidence: 2-6 short strings, each = one observation and what it implies.
- transcribed_text: every mark/word from the photos and the dealer's markings, cleaned and de-duplicated.
- price_range: low/high = realistic dealer retail band in whole dollars, NEVER all zeros; suggested_retail inside the band;
  floor = lowest you'd accept; basis = one plain sentence on how you priced it.
- listing.title: <= 80 chars, searchable (maker, period, type). listing.description: 2-3 short paragraphs for a shop website.
- listing.condition_grade: one of Excellent, Very good, Good, Fair, Poor, As-is.
- questions_for_dealer: 1-2 things that would most change the appraisal if known. Each is ONE
  plain question ending in a question mark and NOTHING else. Never append the possible answers to
  it - they belong in dealer_questions.options, and the dealer sees them as buttons already.
- If the photographs do not settle what the item is — out of focus, too far away, the wrong face of
  the object, a detail you cannot read — say so plainly in confidence AND make the FIRST entry in
  questions_for_dealer the single specific photograph that would settle it: which face, which mark,
  from how close. "A close, sharp photo of the stamp on the base" is useful; "more photos" is not.
  Trust what the dealer wrote over what you think you see: they are holding the object.
- dealer_questions: when you are unsure, 1-3 questions the DEALER can answer by looking at the
  object in their hand, each with 2-4 short tappable options. They are standing at a sale holding
  the thing; a tap costs them a second and typing costs them a minute.
  Ask about what is visible or measurable, never about judgement: "Is there a mint mark under the
  date?" ["Yes","No","Can't tell"], "What years are on the coins?" ["1942-45","Other","Mixed"],
  "Does a magnet stick to it?" ["Yes","No"]. Options must be mutually exclusive, under 24
  characters, and phrased as the dealer's answer. Include "Can't tell" whenever it is a real
  possibility. Ask nothing you could answer yourself from the photographs.
- shipping: your best estimate of the item ITSELF, unpacked. item_weight_lb in pounds (decimals ok,
  e.g. 0.3 for a teacup, 4 for a 12x18 framed oil, 25 for a 5-gallon crock). item_in = its
  length, width, height in inches, largest first. If the dealer states a size or weight, use
  theirs exactly. fragile = true for glass, ceramic, porcelain, framed art under glass, anything
  that breaks. basis = a few words on what you based it on. Never leave these at zero.
- Never ask again what the dealer's description already answers. It often holds earlier questions
  with their answers as "question: answer" - "No" and "None" are answers, not gaps. Ask about
  something new, or ask nothing.

// COLD COMPS, 2026-09-24. The earlier estimate is deliberately NOT passed any more. Measured with
// tools/kept_pool_check.mjs: seeded with a prior at 0.40x of the market median, the pass returned
// a final price at a median of 0.69x of that median, and 16 of 30 runs never climbed above 0.70x.
// One came back at $165 against a $562.50 median, BELOW the $225 it had been given. Handed a
// number, this model treats it as an anchor and recovers about half the distance to the market.
//
// In production that anchor is the first pass's own guess, formed before a single listing was
// seen, so a bad first guess survived into the final number rather than being corrected by the
// evidence. The listings are the better evidence; the prior is a memory. So the prior is withheld
// and the price is formed from the comparables cold.

// Butterprint set worth about $250 and a Pumpkin or Yellow one worth four times as much, sharing
// every search term they have. Publishing "$125-$1,115" as one range is not a price, and
// trimming the top two would quietly misprice the dealer who owns the rare one.
//
// So: find the largest price gap, and treat it as a boundary only if both sides hold at least
// two listings. One item across a gap is an outlier; several is a market.

// has appeared in the gap and drops the largest ratio to 2.48, just under the threshold. The two
// markets are still there — everything at $1,000+ is a Pumpkin or Yellow colourway — but one
// bridging listing is enough to hide them from a gap-based test. Lowering the threshold to catch
// this one pool would be fitting a sample, not fixing the method.
//
// The method that would work reads the titles, not the prices: the model can already name what

Rules:
- fine_troy_oz is the TOTAL pure metal across every piece, not per item and not gross weight.
- Multiply out counts: "4 rolls of wartime nickels" = 4 x 40 = 160 coins.
- Common fine weights: US 90% silver dime 0.0723 ozt, quarter 0.1808, half 0.3617, dollar 0.7734;
  40% silver half (1965-1970) 0.1479; wartime nickel (1942-1945) 0.0563; Silver Eagle 1.0.
  Sterling .925 and coin silver .900 multiply gross weight by that fraction.
  Gold: 10k = .4167, 14k = .5833, 18k = .750, 22k = .9167 of gross weight.
- Silver PLATE, silverplate, EPNS, "German silver", nickel silver contain NO recoverable silver: return "none".
- WEIGHTED / LOADED pieces are mostly cement or pitch, not metal: sterling knife handles, most candlesticks,
  weighted compotes and trophy bases. Do NOT multiply their gross weight. A weighted knife holds roughly
  0.5-1 ozt of actual silver regardless of how heavy it feels; a weighted candlestick roughly 2-4 ozt.
  If a lot mixes weighted and solid pieces and you cannot separate them, still answer: treat the knives as
  weighted (about 0.75 ozt each), treat everything else as solid at gross x fineness, and state that
  assumption in "basis". Do NOT return "none" for a lot whose weight or count you were given — a
  conservative number is useful, a refusal is not. When genuinely torn, UNDERSTATE: this becomes a price
  floor, and too high a floor costs the dealer a sale.
- If the piece is not precious metal, or you cannot establish a weight or count, return metal "none" and 0.
- Never guess a weight you have no basis for. confidence 0.0-1.0.`;
