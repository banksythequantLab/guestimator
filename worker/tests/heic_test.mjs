// appraisal relies on dealer text only", an identification of "Vintage Red and Blue Painted
// Wooden Sign Board", and four lines of evidence every one of which began "Dealer reports".
// The warning fired correctly and was still useless, because it named a symptom rather than the
// one setting that fixes it.
